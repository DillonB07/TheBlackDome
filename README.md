# The Black Dome

> The voice acting is currently not in this public project. Hopefully this can be added soon!

For my A2 college project, we had the brief to create a full-dome interactive to be played on a planetarium. Me and two friends decided that we wanted to create an interactive educational show based upon the Black Death.

The interactive part of this show is a website that you can use to vote on what you want Fleeb, the teacher, to talk about next.
The website & server source code is at [DillonB07/TheBlackDomeServer](https://github.com/DillonB07/TheBlackDomeServer).
